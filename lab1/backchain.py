# This function, which you need to write, takes in a hypothesis
# that can be determined using a set of rules, and outputs a goal
# tree of which statements it would need to test to prove that
# hypothesis. Refer to the problem set (section 2) for more
# detailed specifications and examples.

# Note that this function is supposed to be a general
# backchainer.  You should not hard-code anything that is
# specific to a particular rule set.  The backchainer will be
# tested on things other than ZOOKEEPER_RULES.


def backchain_to_goal_tree(rules, hypothesis):
    #check through all the rules, see if their consequents match the hypothesis,
    #could use match(pattern, datum) to match the rules' consequents (rule.consequent) to one of the hypotheses.
    #if they do, populate antecedent and add to goal tree
    #they are either a leaf or a rule expression, 
    #keep backchaining untill we get a full goal tree


    raise NotImplementedError

# Here's an example of running the backward chainer - uncomment
# it to see it work:
#print backchain_to_goal_tree(ZOOKEEPER_RULES, 'opus is a penguin')
